**FUNDAMENTAL OF ETHERNET LANS**

**OVERVIEW OF LANS**
- Typical SOHO LANs
- Typical Enterprise LANs
- Ethernet Physical Standards
- Consistent Behavior over All Links Using the Ethernet Data-Link Layers

**Buliding Physical Ethernet LANs with UTP**
- Transmitting Data Using Twisted Pairs
- UTP Ethernet Link
- UTP Cabling for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T
  - Straight-Through Cable Pinouts
  - Chossing the right cable pinouts
- UTP Cabling for 1000BASE-T

**Building Physical Ethernet LANs with Fiber**
- Fiber Cabling Transmission Concepts
- Using Fiber with Ethernet 

**Sending Data in Ethernet Network**
- Ethernet Data-Link Protocols
  - Ethernet Addressing
  - Identifying Network Layer Protocols with the Ethernet Type Field
  - Error Detection with FCS
- Sending Ethernet Frames with Switches and Hubs
  - Sending in Modern Ethernet LANs Using Full Duplex
  - Using Half Duplex with LAN Hubs
  
  

**WHAT IS SWITCH?**

**Switching (chuyển mạch)**
- Switching = the procees of transferring data from this place/device -> another place/ device
- Data-link layer

**Switch**
- Hardware device: help devices share data in one network without collision with each other.
- Data need to go to another network: the switch sends it to a router

**HOW DOES SWITCH WORK?**

**Switching Process**
- Frame Reception
- MAC Admac dress Extraction
- MAC Address Table Lookup
- Forwarding Decision and Switching Table Update
- Frame Transition

**Mac address (Media Access Control)**


**ARP (Address Resolution Control)**


**IPv4**

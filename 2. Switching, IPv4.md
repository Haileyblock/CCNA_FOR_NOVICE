**OVERVIEW**
**WHAT IS SWITCH?**

**Switching (chuyển mạch)**
- Switching = the process of transferring data from this place/device -> another place/ device
- Data-link layer

**Switch**
- Hardware device: help devices share data in one network without collision with each other.
- Data need to go to another network: the switch sends it to a router

**HOW DOES SWITCH WORK?**

**Switching Process**
- Frame Reception (tiếp nhận gói tin)
- MAC Address Extraction (khai thác địa chỉ MAC)
- MAC Address Table Lookup (Tra cứu bảng địa chỉ MAC)
- Forwarding Decision and Switching Table Update (Chuyển tiếp và cập nhật bảng chuyển mạch)
- Frame Transition (chuyển gói tin)

**Types of switching**
- Message Switching
- Circuit Switching
- Packet Switching
  - Datagram Packet Switching
  - Virtual Circuit Packet Switching

**MAC address (Media Access Control)**
- Data Link Layer
- 48-bit hardware number of a computer - embedded into a network card (Network Interface Card)
- Physical Address of a network device. 

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol = Giao thức phân giải địa chỉ)**

**What is the ARP Protocol?**
- Address Resolution Protocol (Find the MAC Address of devices) from source IP

**IPv4**
- IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4
- Give each device a unique address (Identification + Location Addressing)


**FUNDAMENTAL OF ETHERNET LANS**
**OVERVIEW OF LANS**

Ethernet = LANs standards that define the physical and data-link layers of Ethernet LANs (originated by IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers))

**- Typical SOHO LANs**
- What we need:
  - Ethernet LAN Switch (many ports)
  - Ethernet cables
  - Ethernet devices or nodes (nút mạng)

- Typical Enterprise LANs

- Ethernet Physical Standards


- Consistent Behavior over All Links Using the Ethernet Data-Link Layers


**Buliding Physical Ethernet LANs with UTP**
- Transmitting Data Using Twisted Pairs
- UTP Ethernet Link
- UTP Cabling for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T
  - Straight-Through Cable Pinouts
  - Chossing the right cable pinouts
- UTP Cabling for 1000BASE-T

**Building Physical Ethernet LANs with Fiber**
- Fiber Cabling Transmission Concepts
- Using Fiber with Ethernet 

**Sending Data in Ethernet Network**
- Ethernet Data-Link Protocols
  - Ethernet Addressing
  - Identifying Network Layer Protocols with the Ethernet Type Field
  - Error Detection with FCS
- Sending Ethernet Frames with Switches and Hubs
  - Sending in Modern Ethernet LANs Using Full Duplex
  - Using Half Duplex with LAN Hubs

**OVERVIEW**
**WHAT IS SWITCH?**

**Switching (chuyển mạch)**
- Switching = the process of transferring data from this place/device -> another place/ device
- Data-link layer

**Switch**
- Hardware device: help devices share data in one network without collision with each other.
- Data need to go to another network: the switch sends it to a router

**HOW DOES SWITCH WORK?**

**Switching Process, is this **
- Frame Reception (tiếp nhận gói tin)
- MAC Address Extraction (khai thác địa chỉ MAC)
- MAC Address Table Lookup (Tra cứu bảng địa chỉ MAC)
- Forwarding Decision and Switching Table Update (Chuyển tiếp và cập nhật bảng chuyển mạch)
- Frame Transition (chuyển gói tin)

**Types of switching**
- Message Switching
- Circuit Switching
- Packet Switching
  - Datagram Packet Switching
  - Virtual Circuit Packet Switching

**MAC address (Media Access Control)**
- Data Link Layer
- 48-bit hardware number of a computer - embedded into a network card (Network Interface Card)
- Physical Address of a network device. 

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol = Giao thức phân giải địa chỉ)**

**What is the ARP Protocol?**
- Address Resolution Protocol (Find the MAC Address of devices) from source IP

**IPv4**
- IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4
- Give each device a unique address (Identification + Location Addressing)


**FUNDAMENTAL OF ETHERNET LANS**
**OVERVIEW OF LANS**

Ethernet = LANs standards that define the physical and data-link layers of Ethernet LANs (originated by IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers))

**Typical SOHO LANs**
- Ethernet LAN Switch (many ports)
- Support wireless LAN connections (802.11, use radio waves to send the bits from one nodes to the bits, using AP (Access Point))
- Wireless Router (include router, switch, access point): do all the fuction.
  
**Typical Enterprise LANs**
- We need a distribution switch (SWD) which connect to other switches, and router to connect to other WANs

**Ethernet Physical Standards**
- More than 40 years
- Optical and copper cabling (cáp quang và cáp đồng) (The speed: 10 mbps -> 400 giggabit ps)
- inside: cooper wires (dây đồng) + glass fibers

**Consistent Behavior over All Links Using the Ethernet Data-Link Layers**
- Data-link: send Ethernet frame (Header + Trailer of data-link layer)

**Buliding Physical Ethernet LANs with UTP**
- Transmitting Data Using Unshielded Twisted Pairs (UTP)
  - How to create an electrical circuit
     - We need a loop
     - Encoding scheme: chương trình làm việc mã hoá
     - Circuitry: mạch điện needs a complete loop

    - UTP Cable (the wires twisted together: solve important physical transmission issues (EMI - crosstalk)

  

- UTP Ethernet Link
- UTP Cabling for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T (Rules 
  - Straight-Through Cable Pinouts 
    
  - Chossing the right cable pinouts
- UTP Cabling for 1000BASE-T

**Building Physical Ethernet LANs with Fiber**
- Fiber Cabling Transmission Concepts
- Using Fiber with Ethernet 

**Sending Data in Ethernet Network**
- Ethernet Data-Link Protocols
  - Ethernet Addressing
  - Identifying Network Layer Protocols with the Ethernet Type Field
  - Error Detection with FCS
- Sending Ethernet Frames with Switches and Hubs
  - Sending in Modern Ethernet LANs Using Full Duplex
  - Using Half Duplex with LAN Hubs

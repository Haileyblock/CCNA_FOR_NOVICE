**OVERVIEW**
**WHAT IS SWITCH?**

**Switching (chuyển mạch)**
- Switching = the process of transferring data from this place/device -> another place/ device
- Data-link layer

**Switch**
- Hardware device: help devices share data in one network without collision with each other.
- Data need to go to another network: the switch sends it to a router

**HOW DOES SWITCH WORK?**

**Switching Process, is this **
- Frame Reception (tiếp nhận gói tin)
- MAC Address Extraction (khai thác địa chỉ MAC)
- MAC Address Table Lookup (Tra cứu bảng địa chỉ MAC)
- Forwarding Decision and Switching Table Update (Chuyển tiếp và cập nhật bảng chuyển mạch)
- Frame Transition (chuyển gói tin)

**Types of switching**
- Message Switching
- Circuit Switching
- Packet Switching
  - Datagram Packet Switching
  - Virtual Circuit Packet Switching

**MAC address (Media Access Control)**
- Data Link Layer
- 48-bit hardware number of a computer - embedded into a network card (Network Interface Card)
- Physical Address of a network device. 

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol = Giao thức phân giải địa chỉ)**

**What is the ARP Protocol?**
- Address Resolution Protocol (Find the MAC Address of devices) from source IP

**IPv4**
- IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4
- Give each device a unique address (Identification + Location Addressing)

**FUNDAMENTAL OF ETHERNET LANS**
**OVERVIEW OF LANS**
LANs (Local Area Network): connect devices in the same room, same buliding. (nearby) 
WANs (Wide Area Network): connect devices in large areas (far)

2 main types of LANs: 
- Ethernet LANs - wired LANs (use cooper or fiber-optic)
- Wireless LANs - radio waves 

**Typical SOHO LANs**
- Ethernet = LANs standards that define the physical and data-link layers of Ethernet LANs (originated by IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers))
- SOHO (Small Home/ Home Office)
- Ethernet LAN Switch (which has many ports)
- Support wireless LAN connections (802.11, use radio waves to send the bits from one nodes to the bits, using AP (Access Point))
- Label "Wireless Router" (include router, switch, access point): do all the fuction.
  
**Typical Enterprise LANs**
- We need a distribution switch (SWD) which connect to other switches, and router to connect to other WANs

**Ethernet Physical Layers Standards**
- More than 40 years
- Optical and copper cabling (cáp quang và cáp đồng) (The speed: 10 mbps -> 400 giggabit ps)
- Inside: cooper wires (dây đồng) + glass fibers (sợi thuỷ tinh)

**Consistent Behavior over All Links Using the Ethernet Data-Link Layers**
- Data-link: send Ethernet frame (Header + Trailer of data-link layer)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fa78b73-d62e-4aa2-8a44-afa6d680f67f)

The image showed that the data travel from switch 1 to switch 3 using four different speeds: 10 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 100 Mbps...

**Buliding Physical Ethernet LANs with UTP**
- Transmitting Data Using Unshielded Twisted Pairs (UTP)
  - How to create an electrical circuit (tạo ra mạch điện)
     - We need a loop
     - Circuitry: mạch điện needs a complete loop (vòng khép kín)
     - the cable (wires) will finish the loop and connect the transmitter and receiver.

   - To send data, follow encoding scheme: chương trình/ sơ đồ mã hoá
      - 10 BASE-T (encode a binary 0 as a transition from higher voltage -> lower voltage) 
      - UTP Cable (the wires twisted together: solve important physical transmission issues (EMI - electromagnetic interference (nhiễu điện từ - crosstalk)

**Breaking Down a UTP Ethernet Link**
**UTP Ethernet Link**
  - 10BASE-T (2 pair of wires)
  - 100BASE-T (2 pair of wires)
  - 1000BASE-T (4 pair of wires)  
  - RJ-45 connector has 8 physical locations - 8 wires can be inserted (pin positions - pin) - and then electriciy can flow
  - Small form-factor pluggable (SFP+)
  - Gigabit Ethernet Interface Converter (GBIC)
  - Small Form Pluggable (SFP)
  - Small Form Pluggable Plus (SFP+)

UTP Cabling for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T (Rules)
- Straight-Through Cable Pinouts (cáp thẳng)
  - Must connect to the correct pin positions 
- Chossing the right cable pinouts 
  - Network interface card 

- UTP Cabling for 1000BASE-T

**What is networking?**
- Real life: 2 friends exchange information, share the picture, talk... 
- Computer world: 2 computers exchange information, share the resources

**How does it work?**
- Move data from one device to another device
- Follow the strict rules of : NETWORKING MODEL (INVISIBLE PROTOCOL/ PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS) 

**A. PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS**

**Networking Devices**

I. End devices (Computers, Printers...) 

II. Intermediary devices
1. Network Interface Cards (NICs aka card mạng)
   
2. Repeater (bộ mở rộng Wifi): receive signal -> clean unwanted noise -> transmit the signal again (higher level)
   
3. Bridges (cầu nối): connect many LANs
   
4. Hubs: receive data -> broadcast (copy) -> send it to other devices in the same LAN (no routing -> network collision)
   
5. Switches (bộ chuyển mạch): just like hub, but it doesn't copy, it check the address and send the data to the correct place in a LAN
    
6. Routers (bộ định tuyến aka bộ phát wifi): a connection between LAN and WAN, routing the data,
   
7. Modem (Modulator and Demodulator aka bộ điều giải): analog <-> digital data (0 and 1) 

**Interfaces (giao diện)**
- Interaction between hardware and software components, between human and electronic devices (Software, Hardware, User (CLI, GUI)

**Links**
1. Cables (connect devices to an Internet source)
- Coaxial Cables (đồng trục)
- Shielded Twisted Pair Cables (STP) (cáp xoắn đôi có vỏ bọc)
- Unshielded Twisted Pair Cables (UTP) (Cáp xoắn đôi không vỏ bọc)
- Fibre Optic Cables (cáp quang)

2. Ports
- Serial
- USE (Universial Serial Bus)
- PS/2
- VGA (Video Graphic Array)
- Sockets (speakers, microphones)
- Ethernet
...

**INVISIBLE PROTOCOL**

I. TCP/IP model (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol)

- Department of Defense (DoD aka Bộ Phòng Thủ) - 1960s
- How data transmitted over networks using TCP/IP model: divide data into packet (4 layer)

4 layers (Lowest -> highest)

1. Physical and Data link aka Network Access (Ethernet, 802.11): Tầng vật lý
- Lowest layer
- Transmit the information from one system to others (Ethernet cable, port)
2. Internet aka Network (IP, ICMP): Tầng mạng
- Data is sent correctly and accurately
- IP: Internet Protocol (deliver packet from the source host -> destination host)
3. Transport (TCP, UDP): Tầng giao vận
- Provide a reliable connection between 2 communicating devices
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) + TCP 
4. Application (HTTP, POP3, SMTP): Tầng ứng dụng
- Provide the interface between software and network
- Provide the devices the access network + applications: emails, cloud storage...
- HTTP + TELNET

II. OSI model (Open System Interconnection)

- 7 layers (Lowest -> Highest)

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

Packet Tracer - Investigate the TCP/IP and OSI models in action

**Overview**
- data broken down into smaller pieces (for identification purpose) -> put back together when they arrive (encapsulation process)
- each piece has specific name and belong to different layer

I. Part 1: Examine HTTP Web Traffic 


**PERSPECTIVE ON NETWORKING**

User perspective: House -> modem (Wifi) -> Internet

But now, as a future networking engineer, we need to broaden our mind, and learn deeply about network.

Bigger network: enterprise network

Smaller network: SOHO (Small office/ home office)

**REMEMBER: NETWORKING IS JUST MOVING DATA FROM THIS PLACE TO ANOTHER PLACE**

**TCP/IP NETWORKING MODEL**

Networking model = networking architecture = networking blueprint (mô hình mạng) = set of documents describe one function for a network

Networking model = protocol + physical requirements 

**HISTORY**
- Start build 1970s - Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) was created by The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

  Before: Each computer has their own languages
  
  Now: Allow all computer communicate with each other 

- US Departments of Defense (DoD): Researchers at many universities developed TCP/IP (Volunteered)

**OVERVIEW**

- RFC (Request For Comments): a system of technical and organizational information about the Internet.

  Avoid repeated work
- TCP/IP model: a set of rules (physical, the OS, card...) which allows computer connect with each other.

  Has 5 layers, different functions, many protocols related (bottom -> top): Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Application

**APPLICATION LAYER**
- Provide an interface between software running on a computer and the network itself
- Example: HTTP, POP3, SMTP...
  - HTTP Mechanisms (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
  - Tim Berners-Lee created - 1990s
  - Step 1: Send a message with HTTP header to the server (Request to get a file: Get.htm) 
  - Step 2: Response from server page (with http header + data home.htm)
  - Step 3: more home.htm data (without HTTP header)

**TRANSPORT LAYER**
- Provide services to the application layer protocols 
- Smaller number of protocols
- Example (most common): TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
  - TCP Error Recovery Basics (Phục hồi lỗi)
  - Step 1: When the request + response had been lost through the network (TCP (SEQ =1) + HTTP + Data) 
  - Step 2: TCP feature: Error Recovery: Realized the error and send a TCP back , asking Larry to send message 2 again

  -> Adjacent-layer interaction function on the same computer (tương tác lớp liền kề) (the concepts of how adjacent layers in a networking model work together)
  - Example: HTTP needs error fix -> TCP provide
  -> Same-layer interaction on a different computer (tương tác 2 lớp giống nhau)
  - Example: TCP layer work with TCP layer.

**NETWORK LAYER**
- Many protocol, but one major protocol: IP (Internet Protocol)
- Example: IP Basics: identify the name of end devices + group devices
- Dotted-Decimal notation (DDN)
- IP Routing (Tìm địa chỉ của IP và định ra tuyến đường)
  - Step 1: Larry server send packet to nearby router on the same LAN, it recognizes the IP address and send it to the target
  - Step 2: Repeat the process

**DATA-LINK AND PHYSICAL LAYERS**
- Many protocols and standards
- Ethernet frame examples
- The physcial transmission of data
  - Step 1: Encapsulate IP Packet between Ethernet header and Ethernet Trailer (Ethernet frame)
  - Step 2: Physically transmit it through the Ethernet cabling
  - Step 3: Receive the electrical signal
  - Step 4: De-encapsulate by removing the Ethernet header and trailer

**ENCAPSULATION PROCESS**
- /encapsulated/ 
HEADER/IP HEADER/TCP HEADER/HTTP HEADER/The content of the page/TRAILER
- SEGMENT: transport layer
- PACKET: network layer
- FRAME: link layer

**OSI MODEL AND TERMINOLOGY**
- OSI commonly used by networking vendors, companies
- TERMINOLOGY: PROTOCOL DATA UNIT (PDU)
- L7PDU APPLICATION
- L6PDU PRESENTATION
- L5PDU SESSION
- L4PDU TRANSPORT
- L3PDU NETWORK
- L2PDU DATA LINK
